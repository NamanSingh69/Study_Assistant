*   **Temporary File Storage:** Uploaded files are processed temporarily during content extraction and may not be permanently stored.
*   **Dependency on External APIs:**  The application relies on the Google Gemini API and Google Custom Search API, which require API keys and may have usage limits.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   **Python:**  Make sure you have Python **3.11.9** installed on your system.
*   **Pip:** Python package installer (should come with Python installations).
*   **Google Cloud Account:** You will need a Google Cloud account to obtain the necessary API keys.
*   **Google Custom Search Engine:** You'll need to set up a Custom Search Engine to use the web search feature.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository** (If you have a repository, replace `[repository-url]` with your actual repository URL. If not, adjust this step accordingly):

    ```bash
    git clone [repository-url]
    cd [study-assistant-directory]
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment** (recommended):

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the virtual environment:**

    *   **On Windows:**

        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

    *   **On macOS and Linux:**

        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4.  **Install Python dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    Create a `requirements.txt` file in the root directory of your project with the following content:

    ```txt
    Flask==3.1.0
    youtube-transcript-api==0.6.3
    google-generativeai==0.8.4
    beautifulsoup4==4.12.3
    requests==2.32.3
    ```

5.  **Set up Environment Variables:**

    You need to set the following environment variables.  It's recommended to set these in your shell's configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, `.bash_profile`) or using a tool like `direnv`.

    *   **`GOOGLE_API_KEY`**: Your API key for accessing Google services, including the Gemini API and Google Custom Search API.

        *   **How to obtain a Google API Key:**
            1.  Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
            2.  Create or select a project.
            3.  Enable the **Gemini API** and **Custom Search JSON API** for your project.
            4.  Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials".
            5.  Click "Create credentials" > "API key".
            6.  Copy the generated API key.

    *   **`SEARCH_ENGINE_ID`**:  Your Custom Search Engine ID.

        *   **How to obtain a Search Engine ID:**
            1.  Go to [Google Custom Search Engine](https://cse.google.com/cse/all).
            2.  Create or select a search engine.
            3.  Go to "Setup" > "Basics".
            4.  Copy the "Search engine ID".

    **Example of setting environment variables in `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`:**

    ```bash
    export GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY"
    export SEARCH_ENGINE_ID="YOUR_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID"
    ```

    **Remember to replace `"YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY"` and `"YOUR_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID"` with your actual API key and Search Engine ID.** After editing your shell configuration file, you might need to run `source ~/.bashrc` or `source ~/.zshrc` to apply the changes to your current shell session.

6.  **Initialize the Database:**

    The application uses an SQLite database (`study_assistant.db`). The database is automatically initialized when you run the application for the first time. No manual database creation is needed.

### Running the Application

1.  **Navigate to the project directory** in your terminal if you are not already there.
2.  **Ensure your virtual environment is activated.**
3.  **Run the Flask application:**

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
